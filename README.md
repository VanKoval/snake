# snake

Save the above code into a file named snake_game.py and run the script using a Python interpreter:

python snake_game.py

The game will start, and you can control the snake's movement using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right). The objective is to eat the randomly placed food (symbolized by Ï€) to grow the snake. The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries or itself.
Note that this text-based version of the Snake game is simple and lacks graphics, but it gives you a basic understanding of how the game mechanics work. For a more advanced and graphical version of the Snake game, you'd need to use a graphics library such as Pygame or another GUI library.
